# SS-Typer
A word typing game, inspired from "Typer Shark Deluxe" word typing game, where the task is simple.
You type the requested word, you get point, and your time limit is extended. It is endless indeed.

This program was built with Visual Studio 2017 Community, with .NET Framework.
The "word bank" used for this game was manualy hard coded, with the words from one of my personal English Dictionary.

Take a peek at the "SS Typer" folder, for the project's source code. If you want to test the result only, simply run the .exe file inside the "0. Output" folder, and have fun :)
